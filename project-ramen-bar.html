                <h1> Ramen Bar Website Redesign </h1>
                <p> For my first design project as a UI/UX student (and also the first ever project in my life), 
                    I was assigned to redesign an existing website to fix its interface design problems. I decided 
                    to kick off with the website of Ramen Bar - a local Japanese restaurant in University City, 
                    Philadelphia - as I had already fallen in love with their amazing foods. As a customer, I used 
                    to get frustrated with some of their website’s design problems, so as a designer, I wanted to 
                    propose some solutions to enhance the site’s user experience. Getting started with something 
                    familiar gave me some confidence and enabled me to make mistakes and learn in a “safe” zone. </p>

                <h2> 1. Project Plan </h2>
                <p> I firstly set up a detailed plan and gathered foundational information needed to guide me 
                    throughout the project. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Persona & Main User Tasks: These two tasks were accomplished based on my own 
                        experience as a customer and interviews with other people around me who can be the 
                        target audience of the restaurant. Defining the activities users perform the most on 
                        this website gave me an idea of the site’s most important functions - what I needed to 
                        concentrate my design on.
                    </li>
                    <li> Analysis of the original website: Despite owning a strong color palette for branding, the 
                        website is often seen as a dry and monotonous visual evidence of the restaurant, as the 
                        text overpower visual elements and few beneficial functions to satisfy the customers’ 
                        needs. Therefore, I planned to develop on its existing palette and refine the layout in 
                        the redesign version. I also evaluated how the original website works on different device 
                        screens to identify potential problems with responsiveness.</li>
                    <li> Project goals: As a result of my analysis and research, I listed out the redesign goals. 
                        These goals were carefully deliberated to fit the target audience’s demands and solve the 
                        existing problems of the website.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2> 2. Information Architecture & Research</h2>
                <p> I came up with every kind of content that can and should be on the restaurant’s website, 
                    then created a card sorting exercise for six people representing the target audience to 
                    complete. Curious about different people’s perspectives, I had a short interview with each 
                    person after the exercise to investigate what kind of content they expect to see on the site, 
                    the reasoning on their way of categorizing information. Their answers gave me some interesting 
                    insights as they could be different from my perspective, even though all of us were the target 
                    audience. I carried out a data analysis of the exercise and laid out a site map demonstrating 
                    the most suitable hierarchy that helps users navigate the website.</p>

                <h2> 3. Wireframing </h2>
                <p> This is my favorite part of the project, in which I searched for inspiration, brainstormed 
                    ideas, and explored every potential layout and style for the site. In the first half of the 
                    project in which I focused on designing for the desktop, I worked on the three most important 
                    pages: homepage, menu page, and contact page. I sketched out multiple wireframes for each 
                    page while keeping the research results in mind: how to arrange the information based on 
                    users’ expectations while still highlighting the restaurant’s features. In the end, I asked 
                    several potential users for feedback then finalized one wireframe for each page. I also 
                    created a new color scheme for the site, inspired by the image of sushi.</p>
