            <h1> Ramen Bar Website Redesign </h1>
            <p> For my first design project as a UI/UX student (and also the first ever project in my life), 
                I was assigned to redesign an existing website to fix its interface design problems. I decided 
                to kick off with the website of Ramen Bar - a local Japanese restaurant in University City, 
                Philadelphia - as I had already fallen in love with their amazing foods. As a customer, I used 
                to get frustrated with some of their website’s design problems, so as a designer, I wanted to 
                propose some solutions to enhance the site’s user experience. Getting started with something 
                familiar gave me some confidence and enabled me to make mistakes and learn in a “safe” zone. </p>
